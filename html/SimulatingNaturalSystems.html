        This is a workthrough of "The Nature Of Code: Simulating Natural Systems With Processing" by Daniel Shiffman for the purpose of learning reinforcment. <br>
        The code is transalted to javascript, and HTML5 canvas is used for drawing and animations. <br>

            Preface: Random Walk's: <br> <br>
            A Random Walk is simply a a path defined by a series of random steps. Here is a simple 8-directional random walk. At each step we color the pixel at the <br>
            walkers location black before the next step is calculated by chosing to increment or decrement the walkers X and Y position. <br>
            Random walker's can be used to model real world phenomena such as the movement of molocules in a gas, probablitity in card games, and is even utilized <br>
            in finance.

            Preface: Distribution of numbers: Random Distribution
            <br>
            A pseudo-random distribution of numbers, achived by simply using most launguage librarys random() function will generaly return a close to even <br>
            distribution of numbers. On this canvas we will pick random numbers between 1 and 10 from javascript's Math library, and count how many times <br>
            each number is picked. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Use the "Run" button multiple time's to view new sets of randomly distributed number.
