            As a four person team project and an exerscise in realation databases we built a website for reviewing CONUS national parks. We divided the united states into four regions each with a list of national parks pertaining to that region. Each park has an "offical" web  masters review as well as the ability for users to add a brief review and Hashtags. Parks's can be searched by hashtags(Activities); new parks can be added as well as pertinate information such as name; visitors pre year, elevation; and of course decription.<br>
            The site was built with Java, spring, H2-database, thymeleaf, HTML; and CSS.
