            As a final's project, working on a team of 5 we built a point of sales web application for small resturaunts. We used HTML, Css and JavaScript for the front end UI, and Java, Spring, H-2 Database for the back end. The project was managed using git-hub feature branches and an agile approach to colaboration. <br>The application features multiple views for servers to take and place orders; the kitchen to view managage their open tickets; a till; and a managers page where they can add and remove employees as well as update employee info, add and remove dishes; select a tax rate which is automatically applied to ticket prices; and other various features.<br>
            Employees; food item's; and managers are all stored in the database for persistence and updated accordingly.
